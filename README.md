## Overview

Keylogger is a Python-based malware designed for educational and research purposes to understand the potential risks associated with unauthorized access and the importance of cybersecurity. This project logs keystrokes on a target system, demonstrating how sensitive information can be captured. It is essential to use this tool responsibly and legally.

## Features

- **Stealthy Operation:** The keylogger runs silently in the background, capturing keystrokes without the user's knowledge.
- **Data Logging:** Captures and logs keystrokes in a local file named "output.txt."
- **Remote Data Transfer:** Can send the captured data to a remote machine via sockets.

## Usage

**Disclaimer: Please use this tool responsibly and respect the privacy and legal boundaries of others. The developers are not responsible for any misuse of the software.**

1. **Run the Keylogger:** Execute the script on the target machine.
   
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

2. **Data Retrieval:** The captured data is stored in the "output.txt" file. Optionally, use the remote data transfer feature to send the file to a designated IP address and port.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for educational and personal use only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is against ethical and legal standards. Use this tool responsibly, respecting privacy and adhering to legal guidelines. The developers are not liable for any consequences of misuse.
